# CeaCtl

Cisco Enterprise API Control (`ceactl`) is a Go CLI for querying Cisco MDS
and UCS Manager devices. It currently supports MDS inventory and firmware
queries, UCSM server inventory, and an experimental MDS log-analysis workflow
with local Ollama models.

## Features

- Cisco MDS NX-API integration over HTTPS
- Cisco UCS Manager XML API integration over HTTPS
- MDS firmware version and hardware inventory queries
- UCSM server inventory queries
- MDS log collection or local log-file input
- Mechanical log grouping by severity, facility, mnemonic, interface, and VSAN
- Optional LLM-assisted log analysis through the Ollama Chat API
- Configurable device profiles and verbose request logging

## Requirements

- Go 1.26.3 or a compatible version matching [`go.mod`](go.mod)
- Network access and valid credentials for the target MDS or UCSM device
- NX-API enabled on MDS devices
- [Ollama](https://docs.ollama.com/quickstart) and a downloaded model for LLM
  log analysis (optional)

## Build

```bash
go mod download
go build -o ceactl .
```

On Windows, use `go build -o ceactl.exe .` and replace `./ceactl` with
`./ceactl.exe` in the examples below.

## Configuration

Copy the example configuration before running the CLI:

```bash
cp .config.yaml.example .config.yaml
```

```yaml
devices:
  mds-lab:
    type: mds
    host: 192.0.2.10
    port: "8443"
    username: admin
    password: change-me
    insecure_tls: true

  ucsm-lab:
    type: ucsm
    host: 192.0.2.20
    port: "443"
    username: admin
    password: change-me
    insecure_tls: true

llm_analysis:
  enabled: false
  backend: ollama
  ollama:
    endpoint: http://localhost:11434
    model: gemma4:e2b
  output:
    translate: true
    target_lang: ko_KR
```

Each device must define `type`, `host`, `port`, `username`, and `password`.
When exactly one device of the requested type exists, CeaCtl selects it
automatically. When multiple devices of that type exist, choose one with
`--device`.

`insecure_tls: true` disables TLS certificate verification and is intended
for lab devices or self-signed certificates. Use certificate verification in
production environments. The configuration contains plaintext credentials;
`.config.yaml` is ignored by Git, but it should still be protected with
appropriate file permissions.

The `llm_analysis.output` fields are reserved for future output controls. The
current implementation loads them but does not yet use them to translate or
change the response language.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ceactl mds version` | Show the MDS hostname, firmware version, and uptime. |
| `ceactl mds inventory` | Show MDS component names, product IDs, and serial numbers. |
| `ceactl mds logs analyze` | Fetch, group, and optionally analyze MDS logs. |
| `ceactl ucsm servers` | Show UCSM server DN, model, serial number, and operational state. |

The `mds` and `ucsm` command groups share these flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--config <path>` | Configuration file path (default: `.config.yaml`). |
| `--device`, `-d <name>` | Device profile name from the configuration. |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Print request and session details to stderr. |

Examples:

```bash
./ceactl mds version --device mds-lab
./ceactl mds inventory -d mds-lab
./ceactl ucsm servers --device ucsm-lab
./ceactl mds version --config ./configs/lab.yaml --verbose
```

## MDS Log Analysis with Ollama

`mds logs analyze` first parses the log locally and prints a grouped event
report. With the Ollama backend enabled, it then sends the grouped events to
Ollama, prints the model's analysis, and displays the original message details
for individually cited event IDs such as `E1` and `E2`.

### 1. Install and start Ollama

Install Ollama by following the official instructions for
[Windows, macOS, or Linux](https://docs.ollama.com/quickstart). Make sure the
server is running; depending on the installation, starting the Ollama app may
do this automatically. It can also be started from a terminal:

```bash
ollama serve
```

### 2. Download the configured model

The model name must be identical in Ollama and `.config.yaml`:

```bash
ollama pull gemma4:e2b
ollama ls
```

You can use another chat-capable Ollama model by changing both the pull command
and `llm_analysis.ollama.model`.

### 3. Enable the backend

```yaml
llm_analysis:
  enabled: true
  backend: ollama
  ollama:
    endpoint: http://localhost:11434
    model: gemma4:e2b
```

Set `endpoint` to the Ollama server's base URL without `/api`; CeaCtl appends
`/api/chat` internally. The current Ollama client does not support API-key or
other authentication headers.

### 4. Analyze device or local logs

Fetch `show logging logfile` from an MDS device:

```bash
./ceactl mds logs analyze --device mds-lab
```

Analyze an existing local file without contacting the MDS device:

```bash
./ceactl mds logs analyze --file ./samples/mds.log
```

Filter either source by an inclusive date range in `YYYYMMDD` format:

```bash
./ceactl mds logs analyze \
  --device mds-lab \
  --from 20260701 \
  --to 20260715

./ceactl mds logs analyze \
  --file ./samples/mds.log \
  --from 20260701 \
  --to 20260715
```

`--from` and `--to` are optional. A local-file run still requires a valid
configuration file with at least one device because the command loads the
global configuration before reading the file.

The Ollama request is non-streaming, uses a 128K requested context window and
temperature `0`, and can wait for up to 10 minutes. Large logs or a model's
first load may therefore take some time; the CLI prints an elapsed-time counter
while it waits.

LLM output is preliminary troubleshooting material and may be incomplete or
incorrect. Confirm cited events against the displayed source log details and
collect additional diagnostics before making operational or hardware decisions.
If `endpoint` points to another host, the grouped log content is sent to that
host.
